## Introduction
Common i18n files to be shared across Rise Vision apps, widgets and components.

## Built With

- *NPM*
- *Gulp*
- *Bower*


## Development

### Local Development Environment Setup and Installation

1. Install node dependencies `$ npm install`

2. Install front-end dependencies `$ bower install`

## Development Notes
All translation files go under `/src/locales/{lang}`, where {lang} should be replaced with the language code the translation file applies to. The file extension must be .json.


### Run Local
Run `$ gulp` to see a list of available tasks.


## Build
To build run `$gulp build`. This will generate a `dist` folder with a `locales` folder, containing a combined and minified json file for each locale, named translation_{lang}.json.


## Usage
Install the common-i18n using bower `$ bower install git://github.com/Rise-Vision/common-i18n --save`

The `dist` folder contains the minified version of the `src/locales` folder.

An i18n.js file is provided, which contains an Angularjs module with the necessary dependencies on angular-translate and the static-files plugin. This module can be plugged-in as a dependency on the Angularjs application or component that needs translation of messages.

### Dependencies
- Angularjs
- Angular translate
- Angular translate loader static files
